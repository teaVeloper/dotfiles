Explanation and Comparison

    Key Bindings:
        Key bindings in Qtile are defined using the Key class. I've translated your XMonad key bindings to equivalent Qtile key bindings.
        mod4Mask (Super key) is used as the modifier in both setups.
        Applications are launched using lazy.spawn in Qtile, similar to spawn in XMonad.

    Startup Applications:
        In XMonad, spawnOnce is used to launch applications at startup. In Qtile, the equivalent is to use the @hook.subscribe.startup_once hook. The autostart.sh script is executed here.

    Window Management:
        Qtile uses layout.Floating to manage floating windows. This is similar to XMonad's doFloat.
        You can define specific window rules in the window_rules function.

    Multi-Monitor Management:
        Switching focus between screens is handled with lazy.to_screen in Qtile, similar to XMonad's nextScreen.

    Layouts:
        I've added a few common layouts (Max, MonadTall, MonadWide) that are similar to XMonad's default layouts. You can adjust these as needed.

    Floating Windows:
        The floating_layout variable handles floating windows, and specific window rules are defined in window_rules.

    Bar and Widgets:
        The default bar in Qtile has been set up with some basic widgets. You can customize it further to resemble your XMonad polybar setup.

    WM Name:
        setWMName "LG3D" in XMonad is equivalent to setting wmname = "LG3D" in Qtile. This is useful for fixing Java applications.

    Autostart Script:
        You should create an autostart.sh script in ~/.config/qtile/ to replicate the applications launched by spawnOnce in XMonad.
